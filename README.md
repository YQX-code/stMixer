# Overview of stMixer
stMixer for scalable mosaic integration and label transfer in spatial histology and multi-omics
![](https://github.com/YQX-code/stMixer/blob/main/stMixer/fig1.png)
**a** *stMixer* supports the integration of diverse modalities (including H&E and omics), multi-slide mosaic integration, and label transfer anchored by either histology or omics.**b** For each input slide with spatial multi-modal data, *stMixer* employs a multi-view graph self-supervision module to learn harmony-preserving yet modality-specific representations (top), followed by a self-looped cross-attention mechanism that iteratively fuses these features into a unified embedding $Z_i^{O}$ (bottom).**c** Given multiple slide-specific embeddings as input, *stMixer* jointly optimizes triplet and MMD losses to position biologically similar cells nearby within a shared latent space.**d** For label transfer, *stMixer* introduces a two-stage, graph-enabled cluster-level voting strategy that propagates annotations from reference profiles to query slides.**e** *stMixer* enables flexible integration for spatial domain identification and inter-domain relations characterization, scalable multi-slide mosaic omics alignment, and cross-slide label transfer via soft link.
